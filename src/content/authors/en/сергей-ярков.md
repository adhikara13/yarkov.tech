My name is Sergey and I am a web developer. My main activity is creating web sites. I am interested in areas such as programming, embedded systems, and electronics.
I started making web sites in 2017, starting with simple HTML pages, and in 2019 I started learning programming. At present, I have experience in **full-stack** web development of client-server applications that solve a wide range of tasks.
Some of my personal [projects](/projects/) I put in public access on [Github](https://github.com/sergeyyarkov).

## Purpose of this site

I originally created this website for myself, to consolidate my knowledge by writing articles. 
Since 2022, I have been posting materials on this website, and now at any time I can return to any topic and learn it again.
My articles can also help someone with mastering a particular topic. The main direction of this site is IT, 
and [here](/articles/) I publish materials on topics that interest me, as well as talk about my [projects](/projects/). 
I am absolutely calm about any criticism and I do not claim to be the best programmer in the world, 
so do not judge the materials of this resource harshly.

## Skills

This list shows the skills and technologies that I have used/use in my projects.
For creating web projects, I use **Node.js** and the **Adonis.js** framework for the server-side.
For the client-side, I develop using **React.js** or **Alpine.js**.

<q>this website is made using the [**Astro.js**](https://astro.build) framework and [**Solid.js**](https://www.solidjs.com/) library.</q>
